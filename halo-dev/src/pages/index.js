                    Machine Learning is the field of study 
                    that gives computers the capability to 
                    learn without being explicitly 
                    programmed. ML is one of the most exciting
                    technologies that one would have ever 
                    come across. As it is evident from the 
                    name, it gives the computer that makes 
                    it more similar to humans: The ability 
                    to learn. Machine learning is actively 
                    being used today, perhaps in many more 
                    places than one would expect.
